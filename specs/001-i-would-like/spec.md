# Feature Specification: Library Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i would like to build a library app. Have book catalog, search book, reservation book, book status and stock and user can login into theri profile and any library app basic function. UI/UX minimalize but interactive"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A library member visits the library app to find and reserve books. They log into their personal account, search the book catalog by title or author, check availability and stock status, make reservations for available books, and manage their profile including viewing their current reservations and borrowing history.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** they should access their personalized dashboard
2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they search for a book by title, **Then** they should see matching books with availability status
3. **Given** a logged-in user viewing an available book, **When** they click reserve, **Then** the book should be reserved for them and stock should decrease
4. **Given** a user with existing reservations, **When** they view their profile, **Then** they should see all their active reservations and borrowing history
5. **Given** a user searching for books, **When** no matches are found, **Then** they should see a helpful "no results" message with search suggestions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to reserve a book that just became unavailable?
- How does the system handle simultaneous reservation attempts for the last copy?
- What occurs when a user's session expires during a reservation process?
- How are overdue books and fines handled in the user profile?
